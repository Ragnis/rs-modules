# remoteStorage modules

This is the official repository for remoteStorage community modules.

## Work in progress

We're currently in the process of adding, updating, and polishing the core
modules. Experimental and unfinished modules live in a respective branch named
after the module name.

If you want to help or learn more about how modules work, just hop on the IRC
channel and say hello: irc://irc.freenode.net:7000/remotestorage
